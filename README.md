## Signature_Classification
> Practice Classification Using CNNs in TensorFlow and PyTorch <br/>
> Objective: Classify someone's identity off of their signature

### Schedule
---
01. [x] Create repository
02. Collect signature data
03. Implement simple CNNs in TensorFlow <br/>
NOTE: Follow this tutorial [LSTM TutorialPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tensorflow/tensorflow_recurrent_neural_networks.htm) and instead of MNIST. I have uploaded the tutorial with comments for where we will replace things.
04. Implement other existing models on this data
05. Research image segmentation?
